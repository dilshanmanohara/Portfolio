            at IIT Sri Lanka, in collaboration with the University of Westminster, UK. I'm deeply
            interested in web development and software engineering.

            My journey in technology has equipped me with a strong foundation in various
            programming languages and frameworks. I enjoy creating solutions that make a
            difference and am constantly learning new technologies to stay current with
            industry trends.
